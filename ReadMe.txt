ShapeShooter is a game like system that is inspired by retro games such as asteroids but providing a much more colourful take with various particle 
effects happening as you shoot enemy shapes and as different types of shape collide. With all the particle effects genrating an explosion effect when they appear on screen. 
The system also allows you to use your mouse to rotate the barrel on top of the turret you are controlling(the dark green square) and when you click the turret will shoot towards the direction of your mouse. 

In terms of movement WASD is used to allow for full directional movement and will allow you to control your turret in order to escape all the other shapes chasing and tracking you down based on your postion. 
Your health bar is displayed in the top centre of the screen and once your health becomes zero a game over screen will appear allowing you to reset the game. 
There is also a score system meaning the more shapes you shoot the more your score will increase(as displayed in the top left corner).

So, dodge shapes, shoot shapes and watch the explosion of particles fly.

Notes:
In order to run the prorgam you will need to open the folder in vscode and use the live server extension(once in installed click liver server in the bottom right and select the html file)
